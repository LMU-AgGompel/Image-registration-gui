Image registration GUI
==============================

A graphical interface to manually annotate landmark points on images and register them on a reference shape via thin-plate-spline registration algotihm, built with the PySimpleGUI TKinter framework.
The GUI also provides an interface to train and use a convolutional neural network model to predict landmark positions, and to automatically place additional uniformly spaced landmarks along edges or ridges in the image using an active contour fititng algorithm.

Final version of the software and complete documentation coming soon.
