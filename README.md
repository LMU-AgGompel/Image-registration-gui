Image registration GUI
==============================

This project provides a comprehensive GUI for image annotation, landmark placement, and image registration, while also supporting neural network training and image processing tasks. It uses PySimpleGUI to create the graphical interface and handles various user interactions through event-driven programming.

The GUI also provides an interface to train and use a convolutional neural network model to predict landmark positions, and to automatically place additional uniformly spaced landmarks along edges or ridges in the image using an active contour fititng algorithm.

Final version of the software and complete documentation coming soon.
